## TP 2 Notes

- In exercise 2 we used the 2 different ways of doing geometric transformations. We used translation, rotation and reflexion processes and managed to achieve the tangram requested.

- In exercise 3 we created a unitary cube. In order to use it as a base to the tangram, we translated the cube -0.5 in z direction, then to be parallel to XZ we rotated -90ยบ around X axis and finally adjusted to the requested position.
